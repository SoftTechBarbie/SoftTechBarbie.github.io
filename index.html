    <p>Hi, my name is Karla Vazquez and Im interested in anything and everything tech related.</p>
    <p>I decided to create this space for people who are also on the same journey as me to find a community where we are not afraid of making mistakes.</p>
    <p>I hope this page motivates you to get out of your comfort zone and try something new, because we can do anything we put our minds to.</p>
